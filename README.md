# CanoE-COACH

CanoE-COACH (CEC) is a **desktop app for managing student contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CEC can get your student contact management tasks done faster than traditional nominal roll.

CanoE-COACH aims to help secondary school canoe coaches with managing student contacts and scheduling training sessions.

Some of the features include:
- Adding student records to the student contact list
- Finding specific students to access their records
- Filtering students by their dismissal times to find a suitable timing to schedule a training session
- Ability to tag students to include any extra information such as their level of competency and so on
